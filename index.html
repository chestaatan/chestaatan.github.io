              My industry experience in design management has been an extremely
              varied one as I seek out projects that pique my interest to work on.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the wide range in the scope of work that I do keeps me exposed
              to different management requirements and technical skillsets, I
              enjoy the unique challenges that each task poses.
            </p>
            <p>
              This list does not showcase all the projects that I had the
              privilege to work on but it serves to highlight the breadth of my
              experience in design and management. I also greatly enjoyed the
              experience when I was working on them.

              The Music Staircase is an interactive installation located on the steps of Hard Rock Cafe Singapore at Cuscaden Road. A project done independently, the rugged, waterproof units designed with <b>Fusion 360</b> for low-volume manufacturing transform the 17 outdoor steps outside the restaurant into an original rhythm-based based game console. <b>C+</b> and <b>Python</b> scripts are written to give different song game maps, and the setup is electrically wired for Serial control to ensure scaleability.

              Potato Pirates is a game series aimed at teaching children of age 6 and up coding and computing concepts with the help of a card game. With a bright and high-contrast style for the unique characters drawn with <b>Clip Studio Paint</b>, compelling storyline told through video on <b>Adobe Premiere</b> and an engaging play-mechanism refined through multiple play-tests, it allowed the game to reach international recognition where it clinched the <a href="https://sgmark.org/project-description/?id=89" class="hyperlink_out">Singapore Good Design Award</a>, the <a href="https://www.g-mark.org/award/describe/48310?locale=en" class="hyperlink_out">Japan Good Design Award </a> and the <a href="https://designawards.core77.com/Design-Education-Initiative/73983/Potato-Pirates" class="hyperlink_out">Core77 Design Award</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              A second game was also subsequently made and launched in 2020, but with a focus on cybersecurity and networking.

                Aside from work done with companies, I enjoy picking up projects to work on whenever I have the time to do so. Due to my wide range of interests, the skillsets that are required for each individual project can vary greatly. With no time restrictions on the work that I do for a hobby, I am able to pick up the skills that I require on the side that I would otherwise not be able to be exposed to.

              <p>
                Apart from this website that I built from scratch, below is just a small list of the projects that I have picked up and am particularly proud of:

              <p class="mb-4">
                As an experiment to try out several new features that Solidworks has, a speedboat was designed in order to understand various lesser-used functions such as surface modelling. Extensive research was put into hull design and while no complex speedboat hull plans could be found online for referencing, a combination of real-life photos and theoretical knowledge gleaned from hull design guides online resulted in the final model. The 3D object was then 3D-printed, waterproofed and finished before the electronics, motor and other moving parts were installed.

              <p class="mb-4">
                With a passion for drawing, it is thus not a stretch to want to dabble in 3-dimensional sculpting in order explore and better understand the principles of non-parametric modelling and printing. 
              </p>
              <p>
                To do so, ZBrush was self-taught in this project. Throughout the course of the project, various 3D models were sculpted and then printed with various printers (Fused Deposition Modelling, Stereolithography Apparatus and Selective Laser Sintering printers were utilised) in order to determine the optimal tpe and settings required for printing such models.
              </p>
              <p>
                Afterwards, various post-processing and finishing methods were explored in order to try and achieve a high-quality finish on the models that has the least amount of artifacts on the surface.

                Being a project-heavy course, most modules that I took have at least 1 project that students have to complete in teams by the end of the school term. While some projects can be relatively smaller-scale, a large number of them span months in their undertaking.
              </p>
              <p>
                Below is a showcase of some of the larger-scale projects that I have completed:

              <p class="mb-4">
                A exercise on Industrial Design, the Roomba 581 was chosen to be modelled and analysed to better understand how engineers in the industry make decisions over material choice, part size and efficiency. For the project, the drivewheel and the brush case were torn down, and the gearings, shafts, springs and overall design of the component were first measured, and a 3D CAD was rendered. Alongside with tolerance and safety factor computations that were done manually with the methods taught in class, the parts were checked and the resulting findings written into a report.
              </p>
              <p>
                While the results show that there were no problems with the safety factors for all parts of interest, a redesign was proposed as it was observed that there was significant dust ingress into the moving parts of the system, accelerating its wear and thus decreasing the lifespan of the product.

                The task of demonstrating the use of and the programming a Verilog Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) was required for the course, and designing a custom driver for a 3-dimensional display was chosen as the task to showcase a prime use-case of hardware programming.

                With a 8 &#215; 8 &#215; 8 cube and inbuilt logic for single-player and dual-player 3D pong, the task was a challenging as both hardware and software had to be designed from scratch and many a weekend was spent soldering and testing LEDs in order to finish the demonstration prototype.

                A study into dynamic motion modeling, the passive walker project aimed to study and model the motion of such an object and the constraints required for motion. By modelling the system into 3 different stages, the equations of motion an be computed and the resulting simulation on MATLAB using the three equations were shown to closely resemble the motion of the Passive Walker when tested and measured in real life with Video Tracking technology.

              <p>
                To do so, a new composite was invented. By controlling the soft areas in the material, it is able to deform into various preset shapes and retain that geometry long after the power has been cut.

                A combination of cutting edge fabrication techniques and age-old methods were utilised for the fabrication of the material, where compression moulding and traditional hand-weaving was required to fabricate the test pieces.

                A deep-end curriculum strategy to introducing open and closed loop control systems, a line-following robot had to be designed in the span of 2 days. Powered by an arduino, Line Rider uses an original weighted PID system that allows it to achieve stability and maneuverability at the same time while at speed.

              <p>
                A long chassis design allows for Line Rider to detect early sharp corners and react accordingly, and autocalibration allow the weights to be changed on the fly as the surrounding lighting conditions change over time.

                Built as a 3-axis gripper modeled after human fingers, each tip has a pressure sensor that reads the pressure experienced and a circuit board sends the corresponding average value to an LED array to tell the user how much force is being
                exerted on the object.

                Controls are given by nylon “tendons”, and each individual digit is able to translate 180 degrees from its original position, allowing for the gripper to hold on to any odd-sized objects of a loading of up to 5kg.
